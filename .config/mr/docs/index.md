Main repo on [ïŠ– Framagit][myrepo_repo_url] is just here to propose a
scaffolding repo to setup [myrepos][myrepos]. Its aims is not to store any
deployment configuration.

## Description

From [myrepos][myrepos]:

> You have a lot of version control repositories. Sometimes you want to update
> them all at once. Or push out all your local changes. You use special command
> lines in some repositories to implement specific workflows. Myrepos provides a
> `mr` command, which is a tool to manage all your version control repositories.

In other terms, with [myrepos][myrepos], once configured, the command `mr push`
will push all your configured version control repositories at once.

This current repository propose you a script allowing you to automate the
configuration of myrepos from a user configuration file. The script will
generate a myrepos files for each configured repos and, if ask to do so, it will
update the configuration of the current host.

Moreover, the script also handle the use of [vcsh][vcsh] to also manage your
dotfiles.


## Software Requirements

In this section we will only describe external requirements, i.e. the
requirements that are not indirectly described through requirements files
(e.g.  files `requirements.txt` and `requirements.dev.txt` for python
dependencies).

External software requirements are:

  - bash >= 5.0
  - python3 >= 3.8
  - pip3 (using python >= 3.8)
  - python3-venv (using python >= 3.8, or directly `python3.8-venv` for debian
    based distros)
  - vcsh >= 1.20151229-1

??? note "Hint: Usage of <code>direnv</code> is strongly recommended (click to reveal)"

    [`direnv`][direnv] is not a required dependency but it is strongly
    recommended to use it.

    As many tools used by this repo required environment variables, we strongly
    recommend using [direnv][direnv] to automate loading of these environment
    variables.

    [`direnv`][direnv] is an extension for your shell. It augments existing shells with a new
    feature that can load and unload environment variables depending on the
    current directory.

    In other terms, if a script `.envrc` is present in a folder and allowed for
    `direnv`, it will automatically be executed when entering the folder. When
    leaving the folder any exported variables will be automatically unloaded.

This repos is structured to be cloned with [`vcsh`][vcsh], before continuing, to
used it, you will need to clone the repo with the following command:

```bash
# Clone with HTTPS
vcsh clone https://framagit.org/rdeville.public/my_dotfiles/myrepos.git myrepos
# Clone with SSH
vcsh clone git@framagit.org:rdeville.public/my_dotfiles/myrepos.git myrepos
```

Then, you will need to install python required dependencies to be able to use
the `main.py` script:

```bash
# Go where the script main.py is
cd ~/.config/mr
# Create python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .virtualenv
# Activate the virtual environment
source .virtualenv/bin/activate
# Install python required dependencies in the virtualenvironment
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
