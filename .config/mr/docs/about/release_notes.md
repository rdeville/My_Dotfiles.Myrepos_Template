# Release notes

## v1.1.0

using monorepo in docs.romaindeville.fr.

Thus leading to removing lots of assets and now redundant pages and updating CI.

## v1.0.4

Update link from framagit/myrepo to framagit/myrepos due to repo link update.

## v1.0.3

Minor update to fix upload of dev docs in CI.

## v1.0.2

Minor update, just change the output path to rsync when doing CI dev.

## v1.0.1

Empty release to trigger initial CI.

## v1.0.0

First release of **Myrepo Template** repo with scripts examples and
documentation.

Introduce a simple scripts (which could be improved) to semi-automatically setup
`myrepo` for a bunch of version control repos from a simple YAML config file.
