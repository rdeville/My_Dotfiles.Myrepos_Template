# Continous Integration

The repos use continous integration to ensure regression and validity of the
repo and automatically publish the documentation online if everything is valid.

This documentation will provide you some information and pointer to external
documentation, if you wish to update/upgrade the CI.

## Deploying the CI infrastructure

First of all, you may need to deploy gitlab runner in order to be able to run
the continous integration (CI).

To do so, please refer to the [official
documentation][gitlab_ci_official_documentation].

## Preparing the tests

The python test suite is done using [tox][tox] as testing suite. The
configuration of tox is done in the file [`pyproject.toml`][pyproject_file].

In this configuration some command may be already defined to use other test
tools such as :

* [shellcheck][shellcheck]: Shell script analysis tools
* [isort][isort]: Python import sorting
* [pylint][pylint]: Python linter
* [flake8][flake8]: Python syntax validator
* [black][black]: Python optionless formatter
* [pytest][pytest]: Python test tool
* [mkdocs][mkdocs]: A static site generator to document project with Markdown

You can read this file to understand what is done and refer to previous link to
know how to use testing suite tools.

To run the testing suite tools, simply run the following command:

```bash
# Assuming you are in ~/.config/mr and you install python dev requirements
tox
```

## Preparing the publication of the documentation

The second step to do is to prepare the server on which you will publish the
documentation with the CI. This step will assume your server is accessible using
SSH allowing the use of SSH private key.

To prepare the publication of your documentation, you will need two
informations:

  - The public SSH key of your server
  - Your private SSH key that will be used to deploy your documentaiton on your
   server.

### The public SSH key of your server

You will need the public SSH key of your server trust your server in your CI
process. Assuming your server domain is `mydomain.tld`, you can get its public
SSH key with the following command:

```bash
ssh-keyscan mydomain.tld
```

Output of the command should be like following:

```{.bash hl_lines="6"}
# mydomain.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4p1 Debian-10+deb9u7
mydomain.tld ssh-rsa THISISAVERY[. . .]verylongstring
# mydomain.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4p1 Debian-10+deb9u7
mydomain.tld ssh-ed25519 THISisa[. . .]verylongstring
# mydomain.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4p1 Debian-10+deb9u7
mydomain.tld ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 thisisa[. . .]longstring
```

Line that will interest us this the one with `ecdsa-sha2-nstp256`, the one
higlighted above. Keep it in mind or in a temporary file.

### Your private SSH key

To be able upload to your documentation to your server you will need to generate
a passphrase-less SSH private key.

!!! danger "Doesn't a passphrase-less SSH key will lead to security issues ?"

    Indeed, this could lead to security issues if this SSH key is able to
    connect to your server without any limitation. Hopefully, we can setup SSH
    connection such that use of this key can be limited to the use of a single
    command. This will be explain later.

First generate the passphrase-less SSH key, this can be done with the command
`ssh-keygen`.

```bash
ssh-keygen -f "</path/to/output/file" \
           -C "<explicit comment>" \
           -t "<type>" -b "<size>" -N "<passphrase>"
```

Description:

  * `ssh-keygen` allow lots of thins (see `man ssh-keygen`), here we use it to
   generate an SSH private and public key.
  * Options:
     * `-f "</path/to/output/file>"`: this option allow to specify where the
      private key will be stored, usually in `~/.ssh/`. In our example, we will
      call save it as `${HOME}/.ssh/passwordless_ci_docs`.
     * `-C "<explicit comment>"`: this option allow you to add a comment in you
      SSH key, public and private key. Usually online tutorial ask your to put
      your email address but you can put everything you want. I personnally tend
      to use explicit long comment. In our example, we will use `Passwordless
      SSH key for CI to upload documentation on mydomain.tld server`.
     * `-t "<type>"`: this option is to specify the type of key to create. In our
      case we will use `rsa`.
     * `-b "<size>"`: this option is to specify the number of bits in the key to
      create. In our case we will use `4096`.
     * `-N "<passphrase>"`: this option allow you to specify or update a
      passphrase of the SSH key. In our case, as we do not want to set a
      passphrase, the value will be `""`. **NEVER USE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU
      KNOW WHAT YOUR ARE DOING**, indeed, using such option may leak your
      passphrase as it will be recorded in your command history. In this special
      case, we use it as we do not set any passwphrase with our SSH key.

So, let us now generate our private and its associated public key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f "${HOME}/.ssh/passwordless_ci_docs" \
           -C "Passwordless SSH key for CI to upload documentation on mydomain.tld server" \
           -t "rsa" -b "4096" -N ""
```

Which will output something like:

```text
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/passwordless_ci_docs
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/passwordless_ci_docs.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:1fbkPbpzzEAmibtCHTWxmbxTGK+I2ohDm5+xwSkLCnE Passwordless SSH key for CI to upload documentation on mydomain.tld server
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|           o.    |
|          .+B    |
|          +*=o.  |
|        .+.++* . |
|. E.   .S.o++ o..|
| o. = =. o  ... .|
|.. * B..  .  .+  |
|o . = =. .   ..+ |
|.  . +  .    .o  |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

This will generate two files:

  - ~/.ssh/passwordless_ci_docs, your private SSH key
  - ~/.ssh/passwordless_ci_docs.pub, its associated public SSH key

Now we need to setup our server `mydomain.tld` to accept connection from this
SSH key but restrict usage of this key to specific command in specific folder.
This will add a little layer of security to the usage of this key.

We will restrict the usage of this key to the usage of `rsync` in a specific
folder in our server `mydomain.tld`. In particular, using the script `rrsync`
provided with the package `rsync`. This will assume you have installed `rsync`
on your server.

Let us setup the `rrsync` script in our server. In our server, enter the
following commands:

```bash
gunzip /usr/share/doc/rsync/scripts/rrsync.gz -c > ~/rrsync
chmod u+x ~/rrsync
```

Once the script is setup and executable, you will need to configure the
authorized connection from our previously generated SSH key. To do so, add the
following content to the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, create it if it does not
exists.

```text
command="$HOME/rrsync </path/to/authorized_synced/folder>",no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding <content of your public SSH key>
```

Replace `</path/to/authorized_synced/folder>` by the folder (and its subfolder)
in which you authorize the `rsync` command when using your passphrase-less SSH
key. For instance, assuming you have configured your web server on your server
`mydomain.tld` to render content of the folder `${HOME}/www`, and you want to
allow this key to only sync with an subfolder `docs` withing it, assuming it
exists, then the value will be `${HOME}/www/docs`.

Also replace `<content of your public SSH key>` with the content of the public
key file generated which your private SSH key. In our exemple it is the content
of `${HOME}/.ssh/passwordless_ci_docs.pub`.

So, the content to add to `${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys` is:

```text
command="$HOME/rrsync $HOME/www/docs",no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding  ssh-rsa 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 Passwordless SSH key for CI to upload documentation on mydomain.tld server
```

Now you are ready to setup the gitlab CI to automatically test and deploy your
documentation.

## Automate the tests and deployment of documentation

### Basic Gitlab CI setup
On gitlab, once gitlab-runner has been setup and your test suite are set up, you
can describe jobs to be done in the file `.gitlab-ci.yml`, usually at the root
of the repos.

!!! important "`.gitlab-ci.yml` not at the root of the repos"
    If your file `.gitlab-ci.yml` is not at the root of the repos, which is the
    case for this project, you **MUST** setup the location of this file in your
    project settings in your gitlab instance.

    To do so, go to **Settings > CI/CD** on the left sidebar of your repo. Then
    expand **General Pipelines** section. And finally, update the subsection
    **Custom CI configuration path** as shown below (click on the image to
    enlarge):

    ![!Gitlab Update CI path][gitlab_update_ci_path]

By default, gitlab CI consider three default stages:

  - test
  - build
  - deploy

#### CI `test` jobs

First task to do is to describe the `test` related jobs. Below is the content of
the `.gitlab-ci.yml` for this job:

??? example "Content of CI `build` jobs"
    ```yaml
    # The job name, here called test
    test:
      # At which stage the jobs should be done, here at `test` stage
      stage: test
      # Docker image to use to run the tests
      image: docker:latest
      # Setup variable required for this jobs if needed
      variables:
        # Activation of git submodules if needed
        GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive
      # Setup environment before running actual test command
      before_script:
        # Add python dependencies
        - apk update
        # Install base package
        - apk add --no-cache --update-cache
            build-base
            python3-dev
            py3-pip
            bash
            git
        # Install virtual environment
        - pip3 install virtualenv
        # Create virtual environment
        - virtualenv .venv
        # Activate virtual environment
        - source .venv/bin/activate
        # Install production requirements
        - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        # Install development requirements
        - pip3 install -r requirements.dev.txt
      # The actual test commands
      script:
        # Run tox test suite tools
        - tox
    ```

!!! important

    This `.gitlab-ci.yml` example is for standard git repository, it will not
    work with repository managed with `vcsh` like this project.

#### CI `build` jobs

Second task to do is to describe the `build` related jobs. Below is the content
of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` for this job:

??? example "Content of CI `build` jobs"
    ```yaml
    # The job name, here called test
    build:
      # At which stage the jobs should be done, here at `build` stage
      stage: build
      # Docker image to use to run the builds
      image: docker:latest
      # Setup variable required for this jobs if needed
      variables:
        # Activation of git submodules if needed
        GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive
      # Setup environment before running actual build command
      before_script:
        # Add python dependencies
        - apk update
        # Install base package
        - apk add --no-cache --update-cache
            build-base
            python3-dev
            py3-pip
            bash
            git
        # Install virtual environment
        - pip3 install virtualenv
        # Create virtual environment
        - virtualenv .venv
        # Activate virtual environment
        - source .venv/bin/activate
        # Install production requirements
        - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        # Install development requirements
        - pip3 install -r requirements.dev.txt
      # The actual build commands
      script:
        # Build the documentation
        - mkdocs serve
      # Register artifacts
      artifacts:
        # Paths to save as artifacts
        paths:
          - site/
    ```

!!! important

    This `.gitlab-ci.yml` example is for standard git repository, it will not
    work with repository managed with `vcsh` like this project.

As you can this this jobs differs in two mains things:

  - It does not use `tox` to test the documentation but only use the command
   `mkdocs build` to build the documentation. This command will produce a folder
   `site` at the root of the repos.
  - There is a new YAML key `artifacts` which point to this output folder. In
   fact the key `artifacts` tell to the runner to save the content of the
   defined path in an archive for later jobs, in our case for the deploy jobs.

#### CI `deploy` jobs

Third and last task to do is to describe the `deploy` related jobs. Below is the
content of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` for this job.

??? example "Content of CI `deploy` jobs"
    ```yaml
    # The job name, here called deploy
    deploy:
      # At which stage the jobs should be done, here at `deploy` stage
      stage: deploy
      # Docker image to use to run the deploys
      image: docker:latest
      # Setup variable required for this jobs if needed
      variables:
        # Activation of git submodules if needed
        GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive
      # Setup environment before running actual deploy command
      before_script:
        # Add python dependencies
        - apk update
        # Install base package
        - apk add --no-cache --update-cache
            rsync
        # Ensure ssh configuration folder exists
        - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        # Ensure permission on this folder are right
        - chmod 700 ~/.ssh
        # Trust your personal server public key
        - echo "$SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS" > ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        # Ensure permission on the previously written file are right
        - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        # Start the SSH agent
        - eval $(ssh-agent -s)
        # Add the private SSH key to be able to connect to the perso LIRIS website
        - echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" | tr -d '\r' | ssh-add -
      # The actual deploy commands
      script:
        # Sync the content of the site artifact on your own server at define location
        - rsync -avz site/ "${ONLINE_DEST}"
    ```

!!! important

    This `.gitlab-ci.yml` example is for standard git repository, it will not
    work with repository managed with `vcsh` like this project.


As you can this this jobs differs in two mains from previous job:

  * It `before_script` YAML key is different. Indeed, to be able to use `rsync`,
    and so SSH connection, to send your documentation online, different steps
    are required.
  * It uses environment variables which content is not defined in the YAML. This
   is normal and will be tackle below. These environment variables are:
     * `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`
     * `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
     * `ONLINE_DEST`


As described above, the last jobs required three variables to be set. But before
settings them in the right place, we will first describe their content.

  * `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`, this variable will need to be set to the public SSH key
   of your server, the one you get in section [The public SSH key of your
   server][public_server_key]
  * `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, this variable will need to be set to the content of your
   previsouly generate passphrase-less SSH private key in section [Your private
   SSH key][your_private_ssh_key]
  * `ONLINE_DEST`, the online destination where the static website, i.e.
   artifact `site` should be uploaded, of the for
   `username@mydomain.tld:/path/to/target`. If you specify folder limitation as
   we did in section [Your private SSH key][your_private_ssh_key], then
   `/path/to/target` is relative to the root of the specified folder. In our
   example, we want to upload to `/www/site` where `www` is in the `$HOME` of
   `username`, so value will be `username@mydomain.tld:/www/site`

Now that we know the value of these variable, you can set it for the CI. To do
so, go to **Settings > CI/CD** on the left sidebar of your gitlab instances.
Then expand section **Variables** and then click on the <kbd>Add Variable</kbd>
button.

![!Add CI Variables][add_ci_variable]

An overlay window should appear, fill the **Key** and **Value** field with the
keys and value described above, i.e. `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and
`ONLINE_DEST`.

![!Add Single Variable][add_single_ci_variable]

This should update the list in CI variables:

![!Updated variables list][updated_variable_list]

And that is all. Now each time you push your repo, it will be tested, the
documentation website will be computed and automatically uploaded. You can see
the state of this automation in **CI/CD** on the left sidebar of your gitlab
instance.


### Going further with gitlab CI

Normally, there should already be a file `.gitlab-ci.yml` in `~/config/mr/` with
lots of content. The content of the file is based on :

 - [The Gitlab CI/CD Pipeline Reference Configuration][gitlab_ci_config_documentation]
 - A special YAML feature called [anchor][yaml_anchor] which is supported by [Gitlab CI/YAML Anchor][gitlab_ci_yaml_anchor]

Please read carefully previously linked documentation and read the
`.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which have lots of comment in it to help you understand
what is done.

This CI manage two different kind of pipeline:

  - A development based one, which test the script, build the doc and deploy it
   online but in a temporary folder. This pipeline is automatically run on every
   gitflow compliant branch (except master branch) and on merge requests.
  - A production based one, which test the script, build the doc and deploy it
   online in the production folder. This pipeline is automatically run on master
   branch, i.e. when a release is done.
